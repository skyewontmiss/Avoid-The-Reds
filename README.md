# Avoid-The-Reds
my first game... ever!
in this project, i make a simple cube game, with a terrible menu, a non working save/load system, and music!

How to use:

- just get all the goddamn files (they are just asset files)
- and use lmao


licensed under the Overrule Kaylerr Licensing (by me) which is:

- don't use my stuff and act like it's yours when its not
- change at least one thing lmao please


## ENJOY THE REPOSITORY!
